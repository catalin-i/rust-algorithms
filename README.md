Exercises with data structures and algorithms in Rust

Currently, the data structure and algorithm implementations are stored in module folders. All the tests are contained in the \src\lib.rs file separated into a few modules by category.

In the root dir, run 'cargo build' to compile and 'cargo test' to run all the test packages (also runs the build step).
