Exercises with data structures and algorithms in Rust

Currently, the data structure and algorithm implementations are stored in module folders.
Implementations for the data structures or algorithms are meant to be didatic - these will not feature optimizations for a production environment or exhaustive tests coverage.

In the root dir, run 'cargo build' to compile and 'cargo test' to run all the test packages (also runs the build step).
